# IS7082-Library-Database-Project
Project Title: The Community Library Tracker
Sponsor: Oakwood Neighborhood Association
Users: Library Volunteers and Community Members
Problem Statement:
As the Oakwood "Little Free Library" has expanded to hundreds of titles, the manual "honor system" has become difficult to manage. The association lacks data on which books are currently on loan, which genres are most popular, and which members are active participants. This lead to lost inventory and an inability to curate the collection effectively.
Proposed Solution:
The Community Library Tracker is a relational database designed to digitize the inventory and loan process. By categorizing books by genre and linking them to a membership directory, the system allows volunteers to track the status of every asset in real-time. This system ensures referential integrity, preventing books from being assigned to non-existent members, and provides SQL-driven insights into library usage patterns.
